<p align="justify">
    EPIC IMPOC is an NIHR i4i funded project which aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support system 
    to help doctors prescribe the most appropriate antibiotics. EPIC IMPOC is a collaborative project between 
    medics and other heathcare professionals from the  National Institute for Health Research Health Protection 
    Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) and engineers from CBIT.

<p align="justify">
    Healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat infections must often do so rapidly to prevent harm to 
    their patients. Their prescribing decisions can be assisted by providing them with access to treatment 
    recommendations, based on the most likely organism causing the infection (antimicrobial guidelines) and 
    data on local antimicrobial resistance patterns. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    These decision support systems are mostly rule-based, providing easy-to-access policies or guidelines. A 
    new project started by the Faculty of Engineering and Medicine kickstart scheme, and now funded by the 
    NIHR Invention for Innovation scheme has taken this further, developing anintelligent decision support 
    system. This system is capable of considering a greater number of variables and a more complicated number 
    of scenarios than other systems and by using a machine learning  and artificial intelligence algorithms 
    the system is able to continually learn from its previous experiences.
