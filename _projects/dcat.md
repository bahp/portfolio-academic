    Dengue epidemics can rapidly increase demand in healthcare services across many endemic settings.
    However, there remains a lack of tools which can rapidly inform patient management and can be
    used at the point of care. Digital clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) allow for efficient
    organisation of care as well as improve the quality of patient management. It is important that these
    tools are designed for the end-user and with the healthcare setting in mind to increase adoption and
    usability.

<p align="justify">
    We adopted a ground-up human-centred design approach to design a digital CDSS system for
    dengue management in Vietnam (D-CAT). A multidisciplinary team of data scientists, clinicians and
    social scientists were involved in a series of activities designed to map clinical processes, essential
    tasks and decision-making priorities which were crucial in the management of dengue at our hospital
    setting [1]. The desired features for the CDSS identified were: i) patient organisation, ii) availability 
    of guidelines and calculators with easy access, iii) display of results and iv) inference models for dengue 
    diagnosis on admission [2] and further risk-stratification for hospitalised patients based on possible 
    complications [3]. A web-based reactive framework suitable for display on computers and tablets was produced. 
    Priority was placed on usability and modularity so that the system can be re-purposed.

<p align="justify">
    Dengue Clinical Application Tool (D-CAT) is a bespoke and rapidly scalable CDSS produced following
    clinical pathways, clinicianâ€™s needs, and usability in mind. Further work will focus on prospective
    evaluation and iterative improvement of the CDSS including (i) end-user testing and (ii) prospective
    model performance. If successful, the CDSS will be implemented and deployed to evaluate its clinical
    utility.
