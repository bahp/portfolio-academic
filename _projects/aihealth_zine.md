    The aim of the project is to create a small, accessible booklet in a zine format 
    illustrating the key ideas behind the use of data, AI, decision-support for dengue 
    with a LMIC focus and all the challenges which come with it. We want to touch on 
    specific topics which might include bias, accountability, responsible innovation 
    in a resource-limited context and data use. At the end perhaps a small checklist or 
    call to action for important and/or interesting points to consider.
