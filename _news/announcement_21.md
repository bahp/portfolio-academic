    The <a href="https://bahp.github.io/portfolio-academic/projects/camonet/">Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation 
    Network (CAMO-Net)</a> is a unique global research partnership which brings together institutions from Africa, 
    Asia, Europe and South America to optimise antimicrobial use globally. With the aim of strengthening strategies, 
    fostering collaborations, and sharing knowledge, this partnership conducts a series of collaborative meetings 
    between researchers from the different organizations on a regular basis.

    The aim of this workshop is guide participants through the essentials of dashboard 
    design, specifically tailored for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) data visualization. 
    The session begins with a introduction to key dashbaord design patterns. Afterwards,
    participants have the opportunity to explore existing AMR dashboards, examining 
    data requirements, features, design choices, and common challenges. The workshop 
    culminates in a hands-on activity where participants, will collaboratively design 
    their own AMR dashboards. This includes discussions on data and information display,
    creating dashboard sketches, and presenting their designs for feedback.
