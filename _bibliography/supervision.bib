  abstract={Missing data is a ubiquitous problem in the clinical domain which impacts the fidelity of
    predictive modelling as many of the models rely on the completeness of data. Simple methods such
    as mean or median imputation exist but they do not preserve the relations between variables. As such,
    they do not capture and exploit feature correlations which exists between variables in laboratory data.
    This project presents the design and implementation of an imputation framework which provides a robust
    methodology to investigate two data imputation techniques, Machine Learning and Bayesian Networks, that
    inherently exploit feature relations to infer missing data values from those that are observed. The
    project carries out an empirical study on a real-life laboratory data set to compare the performance
    of the aforementioned techniques against simple median imputation. The project concludes with an
    evaluation of the studied techniques and recommendations on how the methods can be integrated as part of
    an existing clinical decision support system.}

  abstract={Large scale medical datasets and electronic health records have become increasingly
    common, prompting the creation of clinical decision support systems which utilise data
    to enhance health care. Tools have been designed to predict the likelihood of infection,
    automate drug dosing and prescriptions, and evaluate a patient’s risk of death. Adoption, however,
    remains low due to inherent issues, most notably, concern from clinicians regarding the quality of
    recommendations and lack of transparency about how results are obtained.

    This report covers the design and implementation of a system that uses laboratory test
    data to retrieve and present information relevant to a current patient, allowing clinicians
    to make quicker diagnoses and create tailored treatment plans based on past data. Thus,
    using the increasing amount of healthcare data without impinging on clinicians’ diagnosis
    and decision-making process and avoiding the typical objections to automated systems.

    The proposed solution incorporates the results of dimensionality reduction and clustering
    algorithms into an interactive, web-based similarity retrieval application, demonstrating
    the potential of unsupervised-learning based tools in clinical settings.

  abstract={Dengue is a mosquito-born virus that can cause a range of complications to those affected;
    ranging from skin rashes to even death. With no effective treatment currently available and
    vaccines that can have serious side effects, the virus is a major risk to human lives. Detecting
    and predicting a severe case of Dengue can be the turning point in the Dengue epidemic management,
    increasing survival rates of patients experiencing Dengue shock and improving healthcare
    facility processes. Using wearable photoplethysmography devices, which are cost effective and
    user-friendly, patients’ vital parameters can be continuously monitored and analysed, allowing
    for the recognition of patterns that may lead to the development of Dengue detection and prediction
    algorithms. This study will focus on the utilisation of photoplethysmography signals for the exploration,
    design and implementation of supervised machine learning models for the classification of Dengue patients’
    records, based on clinically recorded physiological parameters. Signal and data processing techniques
    will be utilised, leading up to the definition of evaluative experiments and model development. From
    design and implementation to testing and evaluation, we will be presenting our findings in the following
    exploratory report, examining a recently formed PPG dataset.

  abstract={Throughout this project and thesis, a Severe Dengue Predictor was developed and
    deployed on a web-based application. The model uses LSTM as the basis for the neural
    network architecture because of its ability to handle time-series data, especially clinical
    data, which was proven several times through different researches. From the data set
    provided by OUCRU, a small number of features were selected based on correlation
    test and WHO Severe Dengue guidelines: vomiting, body temperature, respiratory rate,
    haemoglobin, haematocrit percent, platelet count, bleeding vaginal, bleeding mucosal, and
    abdominal pain.

    The neural network architecture has had it hyper-parameter tuned before beginning the
    training process. The training result was validating through K-Fold cross-validation process,
    which ensures that biased result is minimal. With models’ performance ranging from
    adequate to excellent, a web-based application has been developed to deploy those train
    models. A random simulation for the application is also shown in this thesis. Through
    those simulation, the performance of this machine learning application is verified to be
    adequate in real-life scenarios.

      which requires corpora manually annotated with named entities. However, manual
      annotation is very expensive and laborious. In this paper, a novel method is proposed
      for training clinical NER systems that does not require any manual annotation. It only
      needs text corpus, a semantic type database like UMLS that can give entities semantic
      types, and a pre-trained BERT representation on biomedical data. Using these resources,
      with a few analyses, annotations are automatically obtained to train the BERT token

  abstract={The photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a signal that measures pulsatile volume of blood in
    tissue and is collected by portable, non-invasive pulse oximeters. PPG signals can be used to
    predict the severity of dengue patients during dengue epidemics. However, raw PPG waveforms are
    susceptible to artifacts and noise. The classification of PPG signal quality is therefore crucial.
    In this work, PPG waveforms are classified into three categories according to their quality, and
    seven signal quality indices (SQIs) are applied to extract the features of each segment of PPG.
    At the same time, the spectrogram of each PPG sample is calculated as another feature. With the
    help of k-means clustering on the SQI features, each sample is labelled with a signal quality as
    ground truth. Apply an autoencoder to reduce the dimension of SQI features to observe the data
    samples in 2-D, and compare the PCA method. Using the above PPG samples and labels as dataset,
    apply decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost classifiers on raw PPG data or SQI features. Build
    a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model for 2-D spectrograms to learn the training set data,
    and predict the test set data. Experimental results show that: SQIs are effective PPG features that
    facilitate quality labelling and dimensionality reduction. The spectrogram is also an effective PPG
    feature, and the CNN has good stability, good flexibility, high accuracy and fast speed to be an ideal
    PPG signal quality classification method.

  abstract={In the early 20th century, the discovery of various antimicrobials solved the medical
    problem of death caused by infection with pathogenic microorganisms. With the large-scale use of
    antimicrobials, hospitals have found that during the use of antimicrobials, some microbes gradually
    develop resistance, making the antimicrobials ineffective. Each year, the number of resistant
    pathogenic microorganisms is increasing rapidly, but the number of new antimicrobials is not enough.
    If unchecked, address and deal with the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) problem, the annual number of
    deaths due to AMR will increase to 10 million by 2050. One of the most important causes of the AMR
    problem is the inap- propriate and excessive use of antimicrobials by doctors and pharmacists.
    Therefore, this project builds an AMR surveillance web page system that can interact with users.
    The system provides doctors with clear and accurate AMR information and recommendations based on the
    collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of recorded susceptibility test data.
