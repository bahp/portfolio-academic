  abstract={Named entity recognition (NER) systems are commonly build using supervised methods
      which requires corpora manually annotated with named entities. However, manual
      annotation is very expensive and laborious. In this paper, a novel method is proposed
      for training clinical NER systems that does not require any manual annotation. It only
      needs text corpus, a semantic type database like UMLS that can give entities semantic
      types, and a pre-trained BERT representation on biomedical data. Using these resources,
      with a few analyses, annotations are automatically obtained to train the BERT token
      classifier for NER tasks.}
